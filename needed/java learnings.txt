The Java String class provides the .compareTo () method in order to lexicographically compare Strings. It is used like this "apple".compareTo ("banana").

The return of this method is an int which can be interpreted as follows:

returns < 0 then the String calling the method is lexicographically first (comes first in a dictionary)
returns == 0 then the two strings are lexicographically equivalent
returns > 0 then the parameter passed to the compareTo method is lexicographically first.
More specifically, the method provides the first non-zero difference in ASCII values.

Thus "computer".compareTo ("comparison") will return a value of (int) 'u' - (int) 'a' (21). Since this is a positive result, the parameter ("comparison") is lexicographically first.

There is also a variant .compareToIgnoreCase () which will return 0 for "a".compareToIgnoreCase ("A"); for example.
